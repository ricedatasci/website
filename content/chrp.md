# CHRP: COVID-19 Houston Response Projects

## Summary

COVID-19 Houston Response Projects (CHRP) is a data science competition that the [Rice DataSci Club](https://datasci.rice.edu/) and the [D2K Lab](https://d2k.rice.edu/) are hosting to encourage all Rice students, grad and undergrad, to get involved in the response to the COVID-19 pandemic.  Students are encouraged to use their data science and computing skills to help solve a number of pressing local challenges.  The competition will consist of weekly submissions with ongoing, multiple cash prizes and the opportunity to present at the [D2K Virtual Showcase](https://events.rice.edu/#!view/event/event_id/84139) to compete for larger prizes.  There is **up to $5k** in prize money on the line for multiple groups to win.  As there are numerous emergent questions which require data science solutions, we are asking you to come together (virtually) to solve them and make an impact in our community!


## Context

COVID-19 or coronavirus is a novel virus that is currently infecting then killing at an exponential rate. The virus is causing major disruptions due to its deadly nature, potential to overwhelm healthcare systems, and social, economic and political upheaval. 

Houston currently has thousands of confirmed cases and 24 deaths. Although the numbers are currently low, there is growing concern Houston could soon be greatly affected because of the city’s proximity to New Orleans, the city with the current fastest growth rate.

## Competition Format


### Goal

Identify actionable insights with respect to novel coronavirus. The scope of your investigation is totally up to you but we are providing data specific to the Houston community.


### Description

The competition will consist of 2 weekly submission opportunities, as well as a final submission at the D2K virtual showcase. You can change your team or topic week to week. Teams may include up to 4 people, and the competition is open to all Rice students, undergrad and grad. You will be judged by the impact, actionability, and technical rigor of your work. Rice faculty will serve as judges. Teams will need a GitHub repo which they will use to submit their findings.
