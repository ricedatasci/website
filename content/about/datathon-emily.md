A junior at Will Rice studying Mathematical Economic Analysis, Statistics, and
minors in Computational Finance and Evolutionary Biology.

I have been playing ultimate for 6 years, most recently with our womxnâ€™s
ultimate team, Torque. In my free time, I enjoy knitting, watching cat videos,
and playing mahjong with my fellow Will Ricers.
