Rice DataSci Club is a student club of Rice University with the following goals:

* To develop Rice University students into sophisticated data analysts through
  hands-on projects and educational events.
* To foster community and act as a unified social hub for the broader Rice data
  science community.
* To provide networking opportunities within industry and academia for
  internship, job, and research opportunities.
* To broadly encourage numerical literacy, clear communication, and teamwork.

We are interested in reaching out to students of all backgrounds interested in
data science to foster a diverse community. This is an especially ripe
opportunity to develop fellowship by connecting the dispersed statistics
undergrads with the vibrant community of CS students, and we’re already seeing
in the Kaggle teams that awesome things happen when these two sides of the same
coin talk to each other. We believe that interdisciplinary collaboration
between these students will develop all involved into well-rounded data
analysts.

Rice DataSci currently has 100+ active members, coming mostly from the COMP,
STAT, ELEC, CAAM and MATH departments. We’ve been astonished by the level of
interest in Rice DataSci and we anticipate growing steadily in size as we
expand our programming.

Rice DataSci is an official student chapter of the American Statistical
Association.

### RDS Officers

Officers are a group of individuals committed to sourcing for and maintaining
shared resources for the club. These include connections with departments and
faculty on campus, Rice affiliates in the data science industry, physical and
financial resources to support executives' operations, and many sources of data
science knowledge we wish we can scatter across campus like flower pollen in
the spring. There are 6 standing officers in RDS.
