Rice DataSci is a club at Rice for undergraduates passionate about Data
Science.  Our goal is to create a coherent and interdisciplinary community for
Data Science at Rice through academic and social events, and by collaborating
with some great university organizations such as the [d2k
lab](https://d2k.rice.edu/) and [k2i](https://k2i.rice.edu/).  

Rice DataSci is an official student chapter of the American Statistical
Association.
